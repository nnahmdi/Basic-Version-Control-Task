# Basic-Version-Control-Task
Explain version control:
Version control is a software development practice that sofware developers implement in their projects in order to track changes to files, documents, and code over time. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simutaneously giving them the ability to track changes, colloborate, and also to revert changes. And in oreder to perform version control a developer needs to make use of a Version Control System (VCS) such as github. 

# Explain the difference between git and github:
Git is a version control system that runs locally on your computer to track changes in files.
On the other hand github is an online platform that hosts repositories and enables team collaboration. It uses Git to manage version control but also provides additional tools like issue tracking, pull requests etc.

git pull: combines git fetch and a merge operation. It downloads changes and automtically integrates them into the current branch.
