# Basic-Version-Control-Task
Explain version control:
Version control is a software development practice that sofware developers implement in their projects in order to track changes to files, documents, and code over time. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simutaneously giving them the ability to track changes, colloborate, and also to revert changes.
